Hello Everyone, my name is Steven Carnes, and I am a programmer with 14 years experience in the field from multiple points of view (Web, Desktop, inside, outside, at the beach).

My current vantage point is that of... "The Cloud".

While looking around from this new vantage point, I have found that resources for those of us that are more "Code-Centric" can sometimes be hard to find.

As a part of my journey tackling the large array of tools, CMPs (Cloud Management Platforms), and Orchestration platforms out there, I have picked up a lot of tricks, tips, and ideas along the way.

My goal, is to share with all of you these nuggets of knowledge as I come by them, and hopefully they will prove useful.

### What kind of posts can you expect?

I am currently building automation in the <abbr title="vRealize Orchestration">vRO</abbr>/<abbr title="vRealize Automation">vRA</abbr> as well as <abbr title="Amazon Web Services">AWS</abbr> space for a major utility and through this work, I have been able to build some really cool things. I want to share my journey through each these builds with you. Some examples of this work can be found below:


- **Load Balancer As A Service**
<div class="well">
By making use of the HTTP-REST plugin for <abbr title="vRealize Orchestration">vRO</abbr> I was able to build a Catalog Item that makes it simple for my clients to request a load balancing setup in a snap.
</div>

- **DNS A Record Creation** and **CNAME Creation** 
<div class="well">
These are also workflows in <abbr title="vRealize Orchestration">vRO</abbr>/<abbr title="vRealize Automation">vRA</abbr>. These workflows communicated with our <abbr title="IP Address Management">IPAM</abbr> solution to build out DNS entries. 
</div>

- **AWS Tagging Notifications** 
<div class="well">
This was build into our AWS offering by combining Lambda's, Workmail, AWS Config, and CloudTrail logging. This was built to notify our users when they built S3 Buckets or EC2 Instances without required tagging.
</div>
